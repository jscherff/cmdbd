# CMDBd
The _**Configuration Management Database Daemon**_ is a lightweight HTTP server that provides a RESTful JSON API for workstations to register and manage information about attached devices. The _**Configuration Management Database Client**_ or [**CMDBc**](https://github.com/jscherff/cmdbc/blob/master/README.md) is the complementary component that collects configuration information for attached devices and reports that information to the server for storage in the database. **CMDBc** can register or _"check-in"_ attached devices with the server, obtain unique serial numbers from the server for devices that support serial number configuration, perform audits against previous device configurations, and report configuration changes found during the audit to the server for logging and analysis. **CMDBd** stores the information in a back-end database.

### System Requirements
**CMDBd** is written in **Go** and can be compiled for any operating system and architecture. This document assumes **CMDBd** will be installed on **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** or **CentOS Release 7** -- or an equivalent operating system that supports **RPM** package management and uses **SystemD** initialization. It requires **MySQL 5.7** or **MariaDB 10.2** or higher for the back-end database.

### Installation
You can build the RPM package with only the RPM spec file, [`cmdbd.spec`](https://github.com/jscherff/cmdbd/blob/master/rpm/cmdbd.spec), using the following commands:
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jscherff/cmdbd/master/rpm/cmdbd.spec
rpmbuild -bb --clean cmdbd.spec
```
You will need to install the `git`, `golang`, `libusbx`, `libusbx-devel`, and `rpm-build` packages (and their dependencies) in order to perform the build. Once you've built the RPM, you can install it with the RPM command. If you're installing the package for the first time, use the `-i` (install) flag to install the package:
```sh
rpm -i ${HOME}/rpmbuild/RPMS/{arch}/cmdbd-{version}-{release}.{arch}.rpm
```
If you're upgrading the package to a newer version, use the `-U` (upgrade) flag to upgrade the package:
```sh
rpm -U ${HOME}/rpmbuild/RPMS/{arch}/cmdbd-{version}-{release}.{arch}.rpm
```
In the above examples, `{arch}` is the system architecture (e.g. `x86_64`), `{version}` is the package version, (e.g. `1.0.0`), and `{release}` is the package release (e.g. `1.el7.centos`). 

The package will install the following files:
* **`/usr/sbin/cmdbd`** is the CMDB daemon.
* **`/usr/bin/bcrypt`** is a utility for generating password hashes.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/config.json`** is the master configuration file.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/store/mysql.json`** contains settings for the datastore.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/store/pool.json`** contains settings for the database connection pool.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/model/queries.json`** contains SQL queries used by the model.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/server/httpd.json`** contains settings for the HTTP daemon.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/server/syslog.json`** contains settings for communicating with a syslog daemon.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/service/auth.json`** contains settings for the authentication and authorization service.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/service/metausb.json`** contains settings for the USB metadata service.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/service/serial.json`** contains settings for the serial number generator service.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/service/logger.json`** contains settings for the logger service.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/service/prikey.pem`** is the private key used by the authentication service.
* **`/etc/cmdbd/service/pubkey.pem`** is the public key used by the authentication service.
* **`/usr/lib/systemd/system/cmdbd.service`** is the SystemD service configuration.
* **`/etc/security/limits.d/cmdbd.conf`** contains system limits for the appliation user account.
* **`/usr/share/doc/cmdbd-x.y.z/LICENSE`** is the Apache 2.0 license.
* **`/usr/share/doc/cmdbd-x.y.z/README.md`** is this documentation file.
* **`/usr/share/doc/cmdbd-x.y.z/cmdbd.sql`** creates the application datastore.
* **`/usr/share/doc/cmdbd-x.y.z/reset.sql`** truncates the application tables.
* **`/usr/share/doc/cmdbd-x.y.z/users.sql`** creates the application users.
* **`/var/log/cmdbd`** is the directory where CMDBd writes its log files.

Once the package is installed, you must create the database schema, objects, and user account on the target database server using the provided SQL, `cmdbd.sql` and `users.sql`. You must also modify `mysql.json` configuration file to reflect the correct database hostname, port, user, and password; modify `httpd.json` to reflect the desired application listener port; and modify other configuration files as necessary and as desired (see below). By default, the config files are owned by the daemon user account and are not _'world-readable'_ as they contain potentially sensitive information. You should not relax the permissions mode of these files.

####Default Accounts
Default accounts are created for the database user and the application users; however, passwords are not configured.

####Database Account Password
For the appliation database account, a database administrator must set the password with the following SQL command:
```sql
ALTER USER cmdbd
IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
```

A system administrator must then configure the password in the datastore configuration file, **```/etc/cmdbd/store/mysql.json```**.

####User Account Passwords
For application user accounts, a system administrator must first choose a good password and then generate a bcrypt hash of that password with the following command:
```bash
bcrypt 'password'
```

A database administrator must then set the password of the application user with the following SQL command:
```sql
UPDATE cmdb_users
SET password = 'bcrypt_hash'
WHERE username = 'username'
```

Future versions of the application will include a utility for creating and modifying application user accounts.

### Configuration
The JSON configuration files are mostly self-explanatory. The default settings are sane and you should not have to change them in most use cases.

#### Master Config (`config.json`)
The master configuration file contains global parameters and file names of other configuration files.
```json
{
    "Console": false,
    "Refresh": false,

* **`ReadTimeout`** is the maximum duration in seconds for reading the entire HTTP request, including the body.
* **`WriteTimeout`** is the maximum duration in seconds before timing out writes of the response.
* **`MaxHeaderBytes`** is the maximum size in bytes of the request header.

#### HTTP Mux Router Settings (`server/router.json`)
Contains parameters for the HTTP mux router and recovery handler:
```json

```json
{
        "AuthMaxAge": 60,
        "PubKeyFile": "pubkey.pem",
        "PriKeyFile": "prikey.pem"
}
```
* **`AuthMaxAge`** is the maximum amount of time in minutes that an authentication token is valid.
* **`PubKeyFile`** is the filename of the public key used in generating authentication tokens.
* **`PriKeyFile`** is the filename of the private key used in generating authentication tokens.

#### Logger Service Settings (`service/logger.json`)
The logger configuration file contains parameters that determine log file names and logging behavior:
```json
{
    "LogDir": "/var/log/cmdbd",
    "Stdout": false,
    "Stderr": false,
    "Syslog": false,
    
    "Logger": {
    
        "System": {
            "Tag": "System",
            "Stdout": false,
            "Stderr": false,
            "Syslog": false
            "LogFile": "system.log",
            "LogFlags": ["date","time","shortfile"],
        },
        
        "Access": {
            "Tag": "Access",
            "Stdout": false,
            "Stderr": false,
            "Syslog": false,
            "LogFile": "access.log",
            "LogFlags": []
        },
        
        "Error": {
            "Tag": "Error",
            "Stdout": false,
            "Stderr": false,
            "Syslog": false,
            "LogFile": "error.log",
            "LogFlags": ["date","time","longfile"]
        }
    }
}
```
* **`LogDir`** is the directory where all log files are written.
* **`Stdout`** causes the daemon to write log entries to standard output (console) in addition to other destinations. This overrides the same setting for individual logs, below.
* **`Stderr`** causes the daemon to write log entries to standard error in addition to other destinations. This overrides the same setting for individual logs, below.
* **`Syslog`** causes the daemon to write log entries to a local or remote syslog daemon using the syslog configuration settings, above. This overrides the same setting for individual logs, below.
* **`Logger`** describes each log used by the application. Each log has the following settings:
    * **`Tag`** is the prefix of each entry in the log.
    * **`Stdout`** causes the daemon to write log entries to standard output (console) in addition to other destinations.
    * **`Stderr`** causes the daemon to write log entries to standard error in addition to other destinations.
    * **`Syslog`** causes the daemon to write log entries to a local or remote syslog daemon using the syslog configuration settings, above.
    * **`LogFile`** is the filename of the log file.
    * **`LogFlags`** is a comma-separated list of attributes to include in the prefix of each log entry. If it is empty, log entries will have no prefix. (This is appropriate for the HTTP access log which is written in the Apache combined log format and already includes relevent attributes in the prefix.) The following [case-sensitive] flags are supported:
        * **`date`** includes date of the event in `YYYY/MM/DD` format.
        * **`time`** includes local time of the event in `HH:MM:SS` 24-hour clock format.
        * **`utc`** includes time in UTC rather than local time.
        * **`standard`** is shorthand for `date` and `time`.
        * **`longfile`** includes the long filename of the source file of the code that generated the event.
        * **`shortfile`** includes the short filename of the source file of the code that generated the event.

#### Serial Number Generator Service Settings (`service/serial.json`)
Contains C language _printf-style_ format strings for generating serial numbers from a seed integer. Serial number formats can be customized for specific device types.
```json
{
    "SerialFormat": {
        "*usb.Magtek": "24HF%04XMT",
        "*usb.IDTech": "24HF%04XIT",
        "*usbci.Magtek": "24HF%04XMT",
        "Default": "24HF%06X"
    }
}
```
* **`*<type>.<device>`** specifies a serial number format for the specific, named device type.
* **`Default`** specifies the default serial number format.

#### USB Metadata Service Settings (`service/metausb.json`)
The USB metadata configuration file contains vendor names, product names, class descriptions, subclass descriptions, and protocol descriptions for known USB devices. This file is generated from information provided by `http://www.linux-usb.org/usb.ids` and is updated automatically from that site every 30 days. You can force a refresh of this file in two ways:
1. Execute the daemon binary, `cmdbd`, with the `-refresh` flag (preferred). This will download a fresh copy of the metadata, store it in the configuration file, and update relevant metadata tables in the database.
2. Modify the `"Updated":` parameter in the configuration file to a date more than 30 days prior.
```json
    "Updated": "2017-10-17T16:54:09.4910059-07:00"
```
#### Datastore Settings (`store/mysql.json`)
The datastore configuration file contains parameters required for the server to authenticate and communicate with the database:
```json
{
    "User": "cmdbd",
    "Passwd": "K2Cvg3NeyR",
    "Net": "tcp",
    "Addr": "localhost:3306",
    "DBName": "gocmdb",
    "Params": null
}
```
* **`User`** is the database user the daemon uses to access the database.
* **`Passwd`** is the database user password. Change this to a new, unique value in production.
* **`Net`** is the port on which the database is listening. If blank, the daemon will use the MySQL default port, 3306.
* **`Addr`** is the database hostname or IP address.
* **`DBName`** is the database schema used by the application.
* **`Params`** are additional parameters to pass to the driver (advanced).

#### Datastore Query Settings (`queries.json`)
The query configuration file contains SQL queries used by the model to interact with the datastore. Do not change anything in this file unless directed to do so by a qualified database administrator.

### Startup
The installation package configures the daemon to start automatically when on system startup. On initial package installation, you will have to start the daemon manually because there are post-installation steps required (e.g., configuration and database setup) for the daemon to start successfully. On subssequent package upgrades, the RPM package will shutdown and restart the daemon automatically.

To start the daemon manually, use the `systemctl` utilty with the `start` command:
```sh
systemctl start cmdbd
```
To shut down the daemon, use the `stop` command:
```sh
systemctl stop cmdbd
```
Refer to the `systemctl` man page for other options, such as `restart` and `reload`.

The daemon can also be started from the command line. The following command-line options are available:
* **`-config`** specifies the master configuration file, `config.json`. It is located in  `/etc/cmdbd` by default. All other configuration files will be loaded from the same location.
* **`-console`** causes _all logs_ to be written to standard output; it overrides `Stdout` setting for individual logs.
* **`-refresh`** causes metadata files to be refreshed from source URLs. It overwrites both local configuration files and corresponding database tables.
* **`-version`** displays the server version, `M.m.p-R`, where:
    * **`M`** = MAJOR version with incompatible API changes
    * **`m`** = MINOR version with backwards-compatible new functionality
    * **`p`** = PATCH version with backward-compatible bug fixes.
    * **`R`** = RELEASE number and optional metadata (e.g., `1.beta`)
* **`-help`** displays the above options with a short description.

Starting the daemon manually with console logging (using the `console` _option flag_) is good for troubleshooting. You must start the daemon in the context of the `cmdbd` user account or it will not be able to write to its log files:
```sh
sudo -u cmdbd /usr/sbin/cmdbd -console
```
You can also start the daemon directly as `root`:
```sh
/usr/sbin/cmdbd -console
```
However, doing so can hide permissions-base issues when troubleshooting. (_For security reasons, the daemon should never run as `root` in production; it should always run in the context of a nonprivileged account._) Manual startup example:
```sh
[root@sysadm-dev-01 ~]# sudo -u cmdbd /usr/sbin/cmdbd -help
Usage of /usr/sbin/cmdbd:
  -config <file>
        Master config <file> (default "/etc/cmdbd/conf.json")
  -console
        Enable logging to console
  -refresh
        Refresh application metadata
  -version
        Display application version

[root@sysadm-dev-01 ~]# sudo -u cmdbd /usr/sbin/cmdbd -console
system 2017/10/18 19:43:39 main.go:52: Database version 10.2.9-MariaDB (cmdbd@localhost/gocmdb)
system 2017/10/18 19:43:39 main.go:53: Server version 1.1.0-6.el7.centos started and listening on ":8080"
```
### Logging
Service access, system events, and errors are written to the following log files:
* **`system.log`** records significant, non-error events.
* **`access.log`** records client activity in Apache Combined Log Format.
* **`error.log`** records service and database errors.

### Database Structure
#### Tables
The following tables contain USB CI (configuration item) objects and supporting elements:
* **CMDB Events** (`cmdb_events`) is not currently implemented. Future versions of CMDBd will use it for centralized event reporting.
* **CMDB Sequence** (`cmdb_sequence`) mimics a database sequence object using an auto-incremented integer column. The value of this column forms the _'seed'_ for dynamically-generated, unique serial numbers issued to devices without preconfigured serial numbers. The `SerialFmt` configuraiton setting in the master configuration file controls how the serial number is generated with this integer value. It is extremely important that this table is never altered or truncated, as it provides a guarantee against duplicate serial numbers. Even if the data in all the other tables is lost or corrupted, preserving this table preserves the unique serial number guarantee.
* **CMDB Users** (`cmdb_users`) contains users, passwords and roles used for authentication and authorizing application clients.
* **Device Checkins** (`usbci_checkins`) contains device registrations. Multiple check-ins will create multiple records. This provides the ability to track device configuration changes over time. 
* **Serialized Devices** (`usbci_serialized`) contains devices with serial numbers. It is populated automatically upon device check-in. It uses a unique index based on _Vendor ID_, _Product ID_, and _Serial Number_, and has only one record per serialized device. The first check-in creates the record; subsequent check-ins update modified configuration settings (if any), update the record's _Last Seen_ timestamp, and increment the record's _Checkins_ counter.
* **Unserialized Devices** (`usbci_unserialized`) contains devices without serial numbers. It is populated automatically upon device check-in. It uses a unique index based on _Hostname_, _Vendor ID_, _Product ID_, _Port Number_, and _Bus Number_. It strives to have as few duplicate records as possible per unserialized device, though this cannot be guaranteed if a device is moved to a different workstation or to a different port on the same workstation. The first check-in creates the record; subsequent check-ins update modified configuration settings (if any), update the record's _Last Seen_ timestamp, and increment the record's _Checkins_ counter.
* **Serial Number Requests** (`usbci_snrequests`) contains requests for a new serial number. **CMDBd** updates new request records with the issued serial number after it is generated. Multiple requests will create multiple records. There is, however, no guarantee that the serial number configuration on the device will be successful and thus no guarantee that the device will appear in the _Serialized Devices_ table. This provides the ability to detect failures in device serial number configuration and also detect fraudulent usage and abuse.
* **Device Audits** (`usbci_audits`) contains a history of audits for each device. Each audit that detects configuration changes creates one record, and each record contains one or more changes encapsulated in a JSON object (see below). The collection of device changes in the JSON object is expanded into individual change records in the _Device Changes_ table. Future versions of this application may deprecate the redundant encapsulated JSON object.
* **Device Changes** (`usbci_changes`) contains a history of configuration changes for each device. Each audit that detects configuration changes creates one record _for each change detected_. Each change is associated with exactly one record in _Device Audits_; each record in _Device Audits_ may refer to one or more changes for exactly one device.

The following tables contain USB device metadata:
* **USB Vendor** (`usbmeta_vendor`) contains USB vendor names associated with specific vendor IDs.
* **USB Product** (`usbmeta_product`) contains USB product names associated with specific vendor and product IDs.
* **USB Class** (`usbmeta_class`) contains USB class descriptions associated with specific class IDs.
